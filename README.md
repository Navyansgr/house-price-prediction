Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms based on various factors such as location, square footage, number of rooms, and more. The dataset is analyzed, cleaned, and used to train models for accurate price estimation.

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains information on various properties, including:

Lot Size, Number of Bedrooms & Bathrooms

Square Footage, Year Built, Neighborhood

House Condition & Quality

Sale Price (Target Variable)


🛠 Tech Stack & Tools

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries Used:

pandas – Data manipulation

numpy – Numerical computations

matplotlib & seaborn – Data visualization

scikit-learn – Machine learning algorithms

XGBoost – Advanced regression modeling



🔍 Steps in the Project

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and scale features.
2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize correlations and key trends.
3️⃣ Feature Engineering: Selecting and transforming important features.
4️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation: Using Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict house prices.
5️⃣ Hyperparameter Tuning: Improving model accuracy.

📊 Key Findings

Location and house condition significantly impact pricing.

Square footage and number of rooms are strong predictors.

**Ensemble models (Random Forest & XGBoost) provide better accuracy.
